# The Grid 

I think I am going to build down in someways to get back to where I want to be but Im bringing the max-width for the full page down to 48em 768px which is nice to have a couple of 2em 32px columns with 32px gaps to really let things breathe.

768 being the max width is pretty slim?
unless I have things that can start breaking out of that I cant really do any columns in the main pieces. all images etc are just not that big even tho its nice to read.

414px (25.em) is iPhone 11 default phone size I need to look at smaller as well but thats 
small screens

maybe I am more liberal about breaking the grid to have some nice vertical text in places and icons can have a triple width grid but the main writting or artworks are full size


Ive got a design in XD starting to come together The main mega images are still never huge but I guess I can run an attachment page if you really want to see those big and beutiful
