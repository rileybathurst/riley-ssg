# Riley Bathurst Portfolio Site 

Im slowly working on porting a wordpress site to a static site so this is how it's going for now.

ðŸª“ [Wordpress Site](https://github.com/rileybathurst/riley)

``` npm run develop ```

``` npm run build ```

## Build

- Gatsby
- // ? Strapi? I dont think this currently has this?

## Issues

- siteDescription
- search
- Breadcrumbs
- Gatsby config file needs some love to get it tidy
- Post class and other progromatic classes
- front page needs a more interesting way of changing the text, sonos does something like this but in a nice way
- lozad changes
- date in footer
- .site-header { is in both layout.scss and organisims.scss with a bunch of overwritting and doubles so I need to figure out what should actually be defined where
- primarymenu.js would be nice to use the qualifiers as the link titles as we have the info

## Names

This should be something cooler than riley-ssg
- Thomas, the second name.
- Something to do with Red.
- Something to do with fox.
- International? Swiss inspired an old artist etc?
- Something to do with static as thats the real change for this, but will that date way too quick? and it should be the point number and I need something more boring.
- my home then it can be point numbered or dated or anything and it updates

- Anchorage
- abode
- domain - this makes sense for the web.


### The Three Headers

#### header_complex 

the front page, top of a category, contact page etc which have the fancy header

#### header_orthodox (not loving the word real quickly) âœ¡ I can find and replace it pretty easy tho as it shouldnt be used in other places?
#### header_stated ðŸ¤”

anything singular with a full width image

#### header_isolated 

A 100vw width page for a specific image or video

#### Others
Not needed yet but it might happen.
I think featured can mean all three so stay away from that

#### Test

Check the branch update

## Tools

I think tools in the CMS should be both frameworks and libraries but also concepts and ideas that I use in the portfolio sites.
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [BEM](http://getbem.com/)
- [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/)
- [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)
- [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox)
- [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)
- [Pagination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagination) this is more evergreen as it can move frameworks and libraries as those come and go but also can be shown again others

The enum for this is hard to title?
- library
- framework
- concept
- idea

Are these different to tags?
yes would be these are more specific you can point to things
no would be less things to manage
