# Riley Bathurst Portfolio Site 

Im slowly working on porting a wordpress site to a static site so this is how it's going for now.

ðŸª“ [Wordpress Site](https://github.com/rileybathurst/riley)

``` npm run develop ```

``` npm run build ```

## Build

- Gatsby
- // ? Strapi? I dont think this currently has this?

## Issues

- siteDescription
- search
- Breadcrumbs
- Gatsby config file needs some love to get it tidy
- Post class and other progromatic classes
- front page needs a more interesting way of changing the text, sonos does something like this but in a nice way
- lozad changes
- date in footer
- .site-header { is in both layout.scss and organisims.scss with a bunch of overwritting and doubles so I need to figure out what should actually be defined where
- primarymenu.js would be nice to use the qualifiers as the link titles as we have the info

## Names

This should be something cooler than riley-ssg
- Thomas, the second name.
- Something to do with Red.
- Something to do with fox.
- International? Swiss inspired an old artist etc?
- Something to do with static as thats the real change for this, but will that date way too quick? and it should be the point number and I need something more boring.
- my home then it can be point numbered or dated or anything and it updates

- Anchorage
- abode
- domain - this makes sense for the web.


### The Three Headers

#### header_complex 

the front page, top of a category, contact page etc which have the fancy header

#### header_orthodox (not loving the word real quickly) âœ¡ I can find and replace it pretty easy tho as it shouldnt be used in other places?
#### header_stated ðŸ¤”

anything singular with a full width image


#### header_isolated 

A 100vw width page for a specific image or video

#### Others
Not needed yet but it might happen.
I think featured can mean all three so stay away from that
